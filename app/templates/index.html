  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Clean and Simple.</p>
<p>When I decided it was time build my own webpage, I wanted the code, the UI, the blog, everything, to be clean and simple. </p>
<p>This post documents that steps it took to build this site, and offers a explanation of how you can do it yourself.</p>
<h2>Building the Backend</h2>
<p>The site you are currently looking at is comprised of static pages. All of these pages are generated by a Flask package called Flask-Frozen.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY Principle</a>, I'm not going to try and explain things that people have done, but rather, point you toward the documentation I used to create the pages. </p>
<p>James Harding has an excellent post describing how to get a Flask site up and running use Flask-FlatPages and Flask-Frozen. <a href="http://www.jamesharding.ca/posts/simple-static-markdown-blog-in-flask/">Check it out.</a></p>
<p>Now, one thing I want to point out about that tutorial is that, everything is contained in 1 file. </p>
